## Create your Google Cloud project

#### To create a Google API project:
- Open the Google Developers Console.
- Click on "Create Project".
- Supply a project name and click "Create".
- Once the project has been created, a page appears that displays your project ID and project number. For example, Project Number: 670330094152.

#### Add a config file to your project
- Get a config file by pressing the 'get a configuration file' button on **[this page](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/client?configured=false)**.
- Copy the config file into your App/ or Mobile/ directory of your Android Studio project.
- (Mac or Linux) Open the Android Studio terminal pane and enter the command: $ mv path-to-download/google-services.json app/
- (Windows) Open the Android Studio terminal pane and enter the command: $ move path-to-download/google-services.json app/
- Add the dependency to your project-level build.gradle file with the line: classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:1.5.0-beta2'
- Add the plugin to your app-level build.gradle file with the line: apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

#### To enable the GCM service:
- In the sidebar on the left, select APIs & auth.
- In the displayed list of APIs, turn the Google Cloud Messaging for Android toggle to ON.

#### To obtain an API key:
- In the sidebar on the left, select APIs & auth > Credentials.
- Under Public API access, click Create new key.
- In the Create a new key dialog, click Server key.
- In the resulting configuration dialog, supply your server's IP address. For testing purposes, you can use 0.0.0.0/0.
- Click Create.
- In the refreshed page, copy the API key. You will need the API key later on to perform authentication in your app server.
